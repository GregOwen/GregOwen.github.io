* Add explanation of what ripgrep is, don't just link to github repo
* under 3, when you're explaining the code
** you kind of also explain your process to figure out how it worked
** you should be clear about which you're doing at which points
** right now it kind of jumps back and forth
* maybe focus -- are you teaching people about emacs settings or about ripgrep?  both?
* difference between M-x grep and M-X grep-find?
* way to make this work across repos?
* if git rev-parse --show-toplevel throws error if not in repo, how does || pwd save it?

* Intro
** What is a kubernetes ingress?
** Existing explanations are too high level
** Specific questions I want answered
*** How does my traffic flow?
*** How can I guarantee that my ingress is internal?
**** Why would I want this?
*** What happens when I create an Ingress object?
*** What is a kubernetes ingress controller and how does it relate to ingresses?
** What this post will not cover
*** Why you would want to use an ingress
*** The high-level "architecture" function of an ingress (that's what all the other blog posts do)
* An ingress is a piece of configuration for an ingress controller
** It does not create any infrastructure
** If you do not have an ingress controller, it does nothing
** If you have an ingress controller, the ingresses all get merged into a single set of rules for the controller
** Why would you want this?
*** Distribution of routing config instead of a single centralized table
**** Kind of like Bazel build files
* Ok, so what is an ingress controller?
** This is the actual infrastructure
** Going to discuss nginx only since it's multi-cloud, supported by k8s, and non-magical
** Essentially, it's a load balancer (the fact that there's an nginx one is a hint)
** The nginx installation guide creates a deployment and a service
*** The service is the actual k8s service that your config will affect
*** The deployment runs the load balancer and updates its rules in response to changes to ingress objects
* How does traffic flow?
** Client --> ingress controller service --> ingress controller pod --> downstream service --> downstream pod
** Let's do an actual trace (can we?)
** Check the logs to see which backend we're hitting
* What happens when I create an ingress?
** Ingress controller polls for changes
** If it finds a change, it updates its internal rules
*** NOTE: it might not always find a change :facepalm:
** Walk through nginx code
* How can I guarantee that my ingress is internal?
** Since traffic flows through the ingress controller service, change that
*** You can verify this by inspecting the ingress and seeing that it has an internal IP
** Why would I want an internal ingress?
*** Ingresses are more powerful than services
**** Fancy load balancing rules
**** Fancy networking rules like VPC pairing
*** Stay tuned for my next blog post...

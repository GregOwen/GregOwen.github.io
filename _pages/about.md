Hello, my name is Greg Owen!

I'm a software engineer who used to be a [chocolate maker](http://www.princeton.edu/~chocolat/) (and before that I was almost a synthetic biologist). I'm currently working at Anthropic on the pretraining team. Before Anthropic, I spent several years at Sigma, where I was the technical lead for [input tables](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/intro-to-input-tables) and then the overall TL for the [AI apps](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/product/ai-applications) org. I started my career at Databricks, where I did a little bit of everything and was eventually one of the TLs in the Serverless org. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily representative of any of my employers, past, present, or future.

This blog is a place for me to store some of the lessons I've learned so that I don't have to make similar mistakes twice. Many of the posts are born from frustration recollected in tranquility. Some of them are about cake.
